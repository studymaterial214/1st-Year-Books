		- Coordinating: Ensuring effective communication and teamwork<br>
		- Controlling: Monitoring and evaluating performance<br>		
		These principles are still widely accepted today and form the foundation of management practices.

In 1970, Codd published a seminal paper titled "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks," which introduced the concept of relational databases and revolutionized the field of database management. His work laid the foundation for modern database systems, and his ideas continue to influence database design and development to this day.

Codd's contributions include:

- Developing the relational model, which uses tables, rows, and columns to store and manage data
- Introducing the concept of database normalization
- Proposing the use of SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and manipulating data
- Receiving the Turing Award in 1981 for his contributions to database management

It provides stakeholders, such as investors, creditors, and regulators, with financial information that is accurate, reliable, and compliant with relevant laws and regulations.

Financial accounting involves:

1. Identifying and recording financial transactions (e.g., sales, purchases, receipts, payments)
2. Classifying transactions into appropriate accounts (e.g., assets, liabilities, equity, revenues, expenses)
3. Preparing financial statements (e.g., balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement)
4. Analyzing and interpreting financial data to make informed decisions

The primary goals of financial accounting are:

1. To provide a true and fair view of a company's financial position and performance
2. To enable stakeholders to make informed decisions about investing, lending, or other business activities
3. To comply with legal and regulatory requirements

Financial accounting is used to prepare financial reports, such as:

1. Balance Sheet
2. Income Statement (Profit & Loss Statement)
3. Cash Flow Statement
4. Statement of Changes in Equity

These reports provide insights into a company's financial health, profitability, and cash flows, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.</td>

	studies. These courses often fulfill the general math credit for high school students.<br>The emphasis in these courses is on computational skills and their
	practical application, with practice being predominant. A (U.S.) business math course typically includes a review of elementary arithmetic, including

	in his research paper "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks".In this paper and later papers, he defined what he meant by relation. One 
	well-known definition of what constitutes a relational database system is composed of Codd's 12 rules. However, no commercial implementations of the
	relational model conform to all of Codd's rules,[4] so the term has gradually come to describe a broader class of database systems, which at a minimum:<br>
	1.Present the data to the user as relations (a presentation in tabular form, i.e. as a collection of tables with each table consisting of a set of rows and
	columns);<br>
	2.Provide relational operators to manipulate the data in tabular form.<br>
	In 1974, IBM began developing System R, a research project to develop a prototype RDBMS.The first system sold as an RDBMS was Multics Relational Data Store
	(June 1976).[citation needed] Oracle was released in 1979 by Relational Software, now Oracle Corporation.Ingres and IBM BS12 followed. Other examples of an
	RDBMS include IBM Db2, SAP Sybase ASE, and Informix. In 1984, the first RDBMS for Macintosh began being developed, code-named Silver Surfer, and was released
	in 1987 as 4th Dimension and known today as 4D.</td>
